PRODUCT: Competitor Change Monitor

Simple. Ruthless. Useful.

What it does (one sentence)

A web app that monitors competitor webpages and emails you what changed, when, and why it matters.

That’s it. No fluff.

WHO IT’S FOR (this matters for selling)

Solo founders

Indie hackers

Small SaaS owners

Agencies watching competitors

Marketers

People who hate surprises more than they hate paying €10/month.

CORE VALUE (why they pay)

They don’t want to:

Manually check sites

Miss pricing changes

Miss new features

Miss repositioning

Miss launches

ChatGPT cannot watch.
Your app watches.

That’s the moat.

MVP SCOPE (do NOT exceed this)

If you add more than this, you slow launch and kill momentum.

Inputs

Email address

List of URLs (start with max 5)

Frequency: daily or weekly

What you monitor

Page HTML text (ignore images/scripts)

Optional later: specific sections via CSS selector

Processing

Fetch page

Compare with last version

Detect meaningful text changes

Summarize differences in plain English

Output

Email only

Simple diff summary:

What changed

Where

When

Link to page

No dashboard needed for v1.

USER FLOW (keep it stupid simple)

Landing page explains value in 5 seconds

User clicks “Start Monitoring”

Enters email + URLs

Pays

Confirmation email

System runs automatically

Emails arrive when changes happen

That’s the entire product.

PRICING (don’t overthink it)

Start with:

€9/month → up to 5 URLs
Later:

€19/month → up to 20 URLs

Monthly subscription. Stripe. Cancel anytime.

You are selling peace of mind, not data.

TECH STACK (Replit-friendly)

Keep this boring and reliable.

Backend: Node.js or Python

Scheduler: cron / Replit scheduled jobs

Storage: simple DB (SQLite / Postgres)

Diffing: text diff library

Email: SMTP (Gmail, Resend, etc.)

Payments: Stripe subscriptions

Frontend: simple form + status page

No user accounts needed at first. Email = identity.

WHAT MAKES THIS NOT A CHATGPT CLONE

This is important for your own sanity.

Ongoing monitoring

Historical comparison

Automated alerts

No prompts

No thinking required by user

They set it once. It works forever.
